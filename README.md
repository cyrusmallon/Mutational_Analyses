# Variant Discovery in Bacterial Genomes
This reposity details the processing of high throughput genomic data. 

This specific project begins with short read illumina data. It contains a shell script for initally passing the data through the breseq pipeline <run_breseq.sh>. This script is designed to run n number of read samples through the breseq pipline in parallel to a computer cluster running SLURM scheduling.
